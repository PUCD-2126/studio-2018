					<h3>Project 2: Digital Editorial</h3>
					<p>Project Brief: You will be designing and building a web-based editorial experience around the topic and content of your choice. The goal of this project is to explore extendable design systems, responsive design and development, digital content design, and typography on the web.</p> 
					<p><b>Content Requirements</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your publication must include at least 10 distinct pieces of content. This content can either be created by you, or gathered from external sources, or (ideally) a mix of the two.</li>
						<li>Any externally sourced content (including entire articles, or individual pieces of media) must be appropriately credited/cited.</li>
						<li>Across all of your content of content, there should be at least one example of each of the following:
							<ul>
								<li>Long-form text</li>
								<li>Pullquote</li> 
								<li>Image (with caption)</li>
								<li>Embedded Video</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Bonus:
							<ul>
								<li>Gallery or slideshow</li>
								<li>Custom interactive element(s) that enhance a specific piece of content.</li> 
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
 					<p><b>Functional Requirements</b></p>
 					<ul>
 						<li>Your publication must include at least 2 navigational systems (e.g. hierarchical and supplementary).</li>
 						<li>Your publication must, at a minimum, have some sort of index view, where one can browse all pieces of content, and some sort of detail view for each piece of content.</li> 
 						<li>Your publication must be responsive, and behave beautifully on a desktop browser, tablet, or smartphone.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>Technical Requirements</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Every line HTML/CSS/JS must be written by you. You may look at external examples for inspiration or guidance, but you must be able to reappropriate any external example by rewriting it from scratch in the context of your own project (no wholesale copy/pasting).</li>
						<li>You must use some sort of grid system.</li>
						<li>You must use webfonts.</li>
					</ul>
